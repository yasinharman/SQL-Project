# SQL Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Introduction
This project is a comprehensive SQL-based data analysis conducted as part of my learning journey in data analytics. It focuses on querying, transforming, and analyzing structured data using various SQL techniques.

## 📚 Background
In today's data-driven world, understanding how to extract meaningful insights from raw data is crucial. This project simulates a real-world business scenario where we analyze job postings and required skills using SQL queries. The goal is to identify trends, most demanded skills, and patterns across the job market.

## 🛠️ Tools I Used
- **SQL (PostgreSQL)**: for querying and data analysis
- **Visual Studio Code**: for writing and running SQL queries
- **Git & GitHub**: for version control and project sharing

## 📖 What I Learned
- Writing complex SQL queries using `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `WITH` (CTEs), and `WINDOW FUNCTIONS`
- Performing data cleaning and aggregation in SQL
- Creating month-wise and quarter-wise breakdowns of job postings
- Understanding how to interpret and visualize raw data trends
- Using Git and GitHub to manage and share code

## ✅ Conclusion
This project helped me strengthen my SQL skills and gain a better understanding of data analysis workflows. It was a valuable experience in simulating how analysts work with large datasets in professional settings.
